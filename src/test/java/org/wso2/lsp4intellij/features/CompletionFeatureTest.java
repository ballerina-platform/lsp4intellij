 * feature that is pure document/string logic and needs neither a language server nor the wrapper
 * it would otherwise call into. The other methods (completion request, lookup item conversion,
 * snippet expansion) need a running server or IntelliJ's completion machinery and have no test
 * coverage — {@code LspServerIntegrationTest} does not reach them; it covers only open/didOpen,
 * edit/didChange, and close/didClose/shutdown.
